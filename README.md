# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Stock Analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve analyze through the stock market dataset for the years 2017 and 2018 as he gathers information to help his parents make an investment decision. In addition, we also want to refactor the original code created to make it more efficient and functional. We'll use the Timer tool to see how fast our new refactored code is able to gather the data requested.

#### Stock Comparison
The two images above show the difference in return for 12 energy stocks in the years 2017 and 2018. In 2017 all but one stock show a positive return. In comparison, in 2018 most of the stock show a negative return on investment, with only 2 displaying a positive return. Within both years, it's safe to say ENPH not only shows positive returns in the two years, but also comes in at a fairly high percentage return.
